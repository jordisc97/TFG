# TFG accidents a la ciutat de Barcelona
Aquest Ã©s un repositori especialment pel treball de fi de Carrera.

Here I'll be uploading notebooks of my thesis about car accidents in the city of Barcelona. 
The thesis is divided in 3 parts:
	
	1.- Predict wounded category in the accidents. Slightly injured, heavy injured or death.
	
	2.- Predict the car model of an escaped vehicle with information such as day of the week, location, brand of the car, number of doors, etc;
	
	3.- Predict what type of collisions are going to occur. 
To do so we are going to mainly use Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks.
